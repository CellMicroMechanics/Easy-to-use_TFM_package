%% Calculate traction with Bayesian TFM
%NOTE: Bayesian TFM is a method to reconstruct traction forces in a
%well-defined manner without requiring low-pass data filtering or
%regularization of the solution. For Bayesian TFM, one requires an estimate 
%of the variance of the measurement noise. The noise variance can be either estimated 
%with knowledge of the experimental conditions or one can provide a displacement sample that
%contains only noise. Such a sample could, e.g., be obtained by tracking
%stationary fiducial markers in a TFM setup.

%use the provided noise sample to calculate its variance [pix^2] 
varnoise = var(input_noise(:));
beta = 1/varnoise;

%calculate with E=1 and rescale Young's modulus at the end
%prepare Fourier-tranformed Green's function and displacement
%NOTE: fourier_X_u shifts the positions of the displacement
%vectors such that the tractions are displayed in the deformed frame
%where the cell is localized

%% Calculate traction with Regularized TFM

%TFM with a given regularization parameter.

%vectors such that the tractions are displayed in the deformed frame
