# Easy-to-use_TFM_package

This Matlab package is a user-friendly tool for calculation of traction forces 
in traction force microscopy (TFM) experiments.  

After downloading, the program can be directly started from the Matlab command line
by entering "TF_reconstruction". The folder 'test_data' contains an exemplary (synthetic)
data set that can be used for first tests.

The package contains two methods: 

1. regularized Fourier transform traction cytometry 

2. bayesian Fourier transform traction cytometry, which is an improved method for
automatic, robust traction calculation.

See the User Manual for details on program usage.
