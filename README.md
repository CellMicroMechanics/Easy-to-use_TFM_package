# Easy-to-use_TFM_package

This Matlab package is a user-friendly tool for calculation of traction forces 
in traction force microscopy (TFM) experiments.  

After downloading, the program can be directly started from the Matlab command line
by entering "TF_reconstruction". The folder ''test_data'' contains an exemplary synthetic
data set that can be used for first tests.

The package contains two methods: 

1. Regularized Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry 

2. Bayesian Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry, which is an improved method for
automatic, robust traction calculation.

See the User Manual for details on program usage.
